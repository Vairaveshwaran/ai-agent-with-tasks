🚀 Overview

This project is an AI Agent System built using LangChain, Autogen, PostgreSQL, and OpenAI’s GPT models. It allows users to ask natural language queries, process them intelligently, and store responses for future use. The system is designed to be modular, extendable, and production-ready.

✅ Key Features

Conversational AI Agent

Uses LangChain + OpenAI API to generate accurate and context-aware responses.

Works as a task-oriented assistant (e.g., summarization, Q&A, reasoning).

Database Integration (PostgreSQL)

All queries and AI responses are stored in a structured database.

Enables history tracking, logging, and analytics on user queries.

Autonomous Tools

Supports extending with tools like math reasoning, web search, and custom tasks.

Can be adapted to include RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for knowledge-based responses.

Optional Export (planned / future)

Responses can be exported as PDF or Word documents.

Useful for reports, summaries, and documentation.

Email Delivery (future feature)

Users can optionally choose to receive the AI’s response as a PDF/Word file sent to their email.

Increases accessibility and convenience.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (core language)

LangChain (for LLM orchestration)

Autogen (for multi-agent workflows)

PostgreSQL + Docker (for data storage & containerization)

OpenAI GPT API (for natural language processing)

📂 Future Enhancements

Add email integration with PDF/Word export.

Build a UI dashboard for easier interaction.

Enable online search and retrieval (RAG) for up-to-date answers.
